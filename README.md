# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Climate Change Sentiment Analysis Project by the data analytics team at Horizon News. Our mission is to harness the power of machine learning to classify tweets into sentiment categories - Pro, Anti, Neutral, or News - with a focus on anthropogenic-caused climate change. This initiative aligns with ongoing COP28 discussions, showcasing our commitment to driving climate change action through innovative data analytics.

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Project Overview

Our primary goal is to develop an advanced machine-learning model capable of accurately categorizing tweets based on their stance on climate change. This application aims to provide Horizon News with valuable insights into public sentiment, enabling us to shape informed broadcasting strategies that resonate with our audience.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation

We prioritize meticulous model training and evaluation, placing a strong emphasis on achieving high accuracy to meet the discerning standards expected from our news broadcasting channel. After comprehensive analysis, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) emerged as the best-performing model, boasting a notably high F1 score.

### 3. Key Findings

Our sentiment analysis has uncovered fascinating insights within each category. "Pro" tweets predominantly align with climate action advocacy, while "Anti" tweets question or oppose mainstream views on climate change. "Neutral" tweets showcase a middle-ground perspective, and "News" tweets emphasize the reporting and discussion of climate change-related news.

### 4. Limitations

It's crucial to recognize the limitations inherent in our project. These include the subjectivity in sentiment analysis, the evolving nature of language, contextual ambiguity within tweets, and potential biases in the training data. Acknowledging these limitations informs a nuanced interpretation of our findings.

### 5. Future Work

Our commitment to excellence extends to future work, where ongoing refinement becomes paramount. We anticipate addressing evolving language trends, accounting for geographical and cultural variations, and ensuring compliance with privacy considerations. Regular updates to training data and continuous model evaluation will be integral to enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of our application.
